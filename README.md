# HackerRank-Solutions

Solutions to [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com) problems implemented in Python 3.

# Tips for doing the problems:

1. Explore + design the algorithm by manipulating sample inputs by hand on the whiteboard.
2. ONCE YOU HAVE AN ALGORITHM, code it up as quickly as possible. donâ€™t get caught in the details, like off-by-one errors. 
   Instead, focus on just getting the process articulated.
3. ONCE YOU HAVE YOUR CODE DOWN, go through and debug it. look for off-by-one errors.
   only move on to the next step after finishing the last step.
